### A [Kodeco tutorial](https://www.kodeco.com/31602619-building-dart-apis-with-google-cloud-run) building MNote, a note management API that any Flutter app can consume. In the process, I learned how to:

- Develop and run servers in Dart using the shelf and shelf_router packages.
- Intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses using middleware.
- Create a Docker image for your project.
- Deploy a Dart API on Google Cloud Run.
